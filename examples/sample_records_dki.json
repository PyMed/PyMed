        "AB": "PURPOSE: Amyloid deposition in the brain is considered an initial event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain of APP/presenilin 1 mice leads to higher diffusion kurtosis measures due to increased microstructural complexity. As such, our purpose was to provide an in vivo proof of principle for detection of amyloidosis by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). METHODS: APPKM670/671NL /presenilin 1 L166P mice (n = 5) and wild-type littermates (n = 5) underwent DKI at the age of 16 months. Averaged diffusion and diffusion kurtosis parameters were obtained for multiple regions (hippocampus-cortex-thalamus-cerebellum). After DKI, mice were sacrificed for amyloid staining. RESULTS: Histograms of the frequency distribution of the DKI parameters tended to shift to higher values. After normalization of absolute values to the cerebellum, a nearly plaque-free region, mean, radial, and axial diffusion kurtosis were significantly higher in APP/presenilin 1 mice as compared to wild-type in the cortex and thalamus, regions demonstrating substantial amyloid staining. CONCLUSION: The current study, although small-scale, suggests increased DKI metrics, in the absence of alterations in diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the cortex and thalamus of APP/presenilin 1 mice with established amyloidosis. These results warrant further investigations on the potential of DKI as a sensitive marker for Alzheimer's disease. Magn Reson Med, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "AB": "Biophysical models that describe the outcome of white matter diffusion MRI experiments have various degrees of complexity. While the simplest models assume equal-sized and parallel axons, more elaborate ones may include distributions of axon diameters and axonal orientation dispersions. These microstructural features can be inferred from diffusion-weighted signal attenuation curves by solving an inverse problem, validated in several Monte Carlo simulation studies. Model development has been paralleled by microscopy studies of the microstructure of excised and fixed nerves, confirming that axon diameter estimates from diffusion measurements agree with those from microscopy. However, results obtained in vivo are less conclusive. For example, the amount of slowly diffusing water is lower than expected, and the diffusion-encoded signal is apparently insensitive to diffusion time variations, contrary to what may be expected. Recent understandings of the resolution limit in diffusion MRI, the rate of water exchange, and the presence of microscopic axonal undulation and axonal orientation dispersions may, however, explain such apparent contradictions. Knowledge of the effects of biophysical mechanisms on water diffusion in tissue can be used to predict the outcome of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) studies. Alterations of DTI or DKI parameters found in studies of pathologies such as ischemic stroke can thus be compared with those predicted by modelling. Observations in agreement with the predictions strengthen the credibility of biophysical models; those in disagreement could provide clues of how to improve them. DKI is particularly suited for this purpose; it is performed using higher b-values than DTI, and thus carries more information about the tissue microstructure. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current understanding of how various properties of the tissue microstructure and the rate of water exchange between microenvironments are reflected in diffusion MRI measurements. We focus on the use of biophysical models for extracting tissue-specific parameters from data obtained with single PGSE sequences on clinical MRI scanners, but results obtained with animal MRI scanners are also considered. While modelling of white matter is the central theme, experiments on model systems that highlight important aspects of the biophysical models are also reviewed.",

        "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate the microstructural sensitivity of the statistical distribution and diffusion kurtosis (DKI) models of non-monoexponential signal attenuation in the brain using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). We first developed a simulation of 2-D water diffusion inside simulated tissue consisting of semi-permeable cells and a variable cell size. We simulated a DWI acquisition of the signal in a volume using a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) pulse sequence, and fitted the models to the simulated DWI signals using b-values up to 2500s/mm(2). For comparison, we calculated the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the monoexponential model (b-value=1000s/mm(2)). In separate experiments, we varied the cell size (5-10-15mum), cell volume fraction (0.50-0.65-0.80), and membrane permeability (0.001-0.01-0.1mm/s) to study how the fitted parameters tracked simulated microstructural changes. The ADC was sensitive to all the simulated microstructural changes except the decrease in membrane permeability. The ADC increased with larger cell size, smaller cell volume fraction, and larger membrane permeability. The sigma(stat) of the statistical distribution model increased exclusively with a decrease in cell volume fraction. The K(app) of the DKI model was exclusively increased with decreased cell size and decreased with increasing membrane permeability. These results suggest that the non-monoexponential models of water diffusion have different, specific microstructural sensitivity, and a combination of the models may give insights into the microstructural underpinning of tissue pathology.",

The sensitivity of DKI to detect the subtle changes in several chosen brain structures has been studied. However, intuitive and holistic methods to validate the merits of DKI remain to be explored. In this paper, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to demonstrate white matter alterations in both DKI and DTI parameters in preschool children (1-6 years; n=10). Correlation analysis was also performed in multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Fractional anisotropy, mean kurtosis, axial kurtosis and radial kurtosis increased with age, while mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity decreased significantly with age. Fractional anisotropy of kurtosis and axial diffusivity were found to be less sensitive to the changes with age. These preliminary findings indicated that TBSS could be used to detect subtle changes of DKI parameters on the white matter tract. Kurtosis parameters, except fractional anisotropy of kurtosis, demonstrated higher sensitivity than DTI parameters. TBSS may be a convenient method to yield higher sensitivity of DKI.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: An effective NMDA antagonist imaging model may find key utility in advancing schizophrenia drug discovery research. We investigated effects of subchronic treatment with the NMDA antagonist memantine by using behavioural observation and multimodal MRI. METHODS: Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) was used to map the neuroanatomical binding sites of memantine after acute and subchronic treatment. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI were used to study the changes in functional connectivity (FC) and ultra-structural tissue integrity before and after subchronic memantine treatment. Further corroborating behavioural evidences were documented. RESULTS: Dose-dependent phMRI activation was observed in the prelimbic cortex following acute doses of memantine. Subchronic treatment revealed significant effects in the hippocampus, cingulate, prelimbic and retrosplenial cortices. Decreases in FC amongst the hippocampal and frontal cortical structures (prelimbic, cingulate) were apparent through rs-fMRI investigation, indicating a loss of connectivity. Diffusion kurtosis MRI showed decreases in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity changes, suggesting ultra-structural changes in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex. Limited behavioural assessment suggested that memantine induced behavioural effects comparable to other NMDA antagonists as measured by locomotor hyperactivity and that the effects could be reversed by antipsychotic drugs. CONCLUSION: Our findings substantiate the hypothesis that repeated NMDA receptor blockade with nonspecific, noncompetitive NMDA antagonists may lead to functional and ultra-structural alterations, particularly in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex. These changes may underlie the behavioural effects. Furthermore, the present findings underscore the utility and the translational potential of multimodal MR imaging and acute/subchronic memantine model in the search for novel disease-modifying treatments for schizophrenia.",

        "AB": "OBJECT: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), a natural extension of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can characterize non-Gaussian diffusion in the brain. We investigated the capability of DKI parameters for detecting microstructural changes in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sought to determine whether these DKI parameters could serve as imaging biomarkers to indicate the severity of cognitive deficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DKI was performed on 18AD patients and 12 MCI patients. Fractional anisotropy, kurtosis and diffusivity parameters in the temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital lobes were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test. The correlations between regional DKI parameters and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score were tested using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: In ADs, significantly increased diffusivity and decreased kurtosis parameters were observed in both the GM and WM of the parietal and occipital lobes as compared to MCIs. Significantly decreased fractional anisotropy was also observed in the WM of these lobes in ADs. With the exception of fractional anisotropy and radial kurtosis, all the five other DKI parameters exhibited significant correlations with MMSE score in both GM and WM. CONCLUSION: Bearing additional information, the DKI model can provide sensitive imaging biomarkers for assessing the severity of cognitive deficiency in reference to MMSE score and potentially improve early detection and progression monitoring of AD based on characterizing microstructures in both the WM and especially the GM.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with International Federation of Gynecology stage I cervical cancer underwent MRI at 1.5 T with a 37-mm-diameter endovaginal coil. T2-weighted images (TR/TE, 2000-2368/90) followed by diffusion-weighted images (TR/TE, 2500/69; b values, 0, 100, 300, 500, and 800 s/mm(2)) were acquired. An expert observer drew regions of interest around a histologically confirmed tumor on ADC maps by referring to the T2-weighted images. Pixel-by-pixel ADCs were calculated with a monoexponential fit of data from b values of 100-800 s/mm(2), and ADC histograms were obtained from the entire tumor volume. An independent samples Student t test was used to compare differences in ADC percentile values, skew, and kurtosis between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, well or moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, and absence and presence of lymphovascular space invasion. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in ADC percentiles between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, but the median was significantly higher in well or moderately differentiated tumors (50th percentile, 1113 +/- 177 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) compared with poorly differentiated tumors (50th percentile, 996 +/- 184 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) (p = 0.049). Histogram skew was significantly less positive for adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.016) but did not differ between tumor grades. There was no significant difference between any parameter with regard to lymphovascular space invasion. CONCLUSION: Median ADC is lower in poorly compared with well or moderately differentiated tumors, while lower histogram-positive skew in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma is likely to reflect the glandular content of adenocarcinoma.",

        "AB": "Recently, non-Gaussian diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) techniques, including q-space imaging (QSI) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), have emerged as advanced methods to evaluate tissue microstructure in vivo using water diffusion. QSI and DKI have shown promising results in clinical applications, such as in the evaluation of brain tumors (e.g., grading gliomas), degenerative diseases (e.g., specific diagnosis of Parkinson disease), demyelinating diseases (e.g., assessment of normal-appearing tissue of multiple sclerosis), and cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., assessment of the microstructural environment of fresh infarctions). Representative metrics in clinical use are the full width at half maximum, also known as the mean displacement of the probability density function curve, which is derived from QSI, and diffusional kurtosis, which is derived from DKI. These new metrics may provide information on tissue structure in addition to that provided by conventional Gaussian DWI investigations that use the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy, recognized indices for evaluating disease and normal development in the brain and spine. In some clinical situations, sensitivity for detecting pathological conditions is higher using QSI and DKI than conventional DWI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) because DWI and DTI calculations are based on the assumption that water molecules follow a Gaussian distribution, whereas hindrance of the distribution of water molecules by complex and restricted structures in actual neural tissues produces distributions that are far from Gaussian. We review the technical aspects and clinical applications of QSI and DKI, focusing on clinical use and in vivo studies and highlighting differences from conventional diffusional metrics.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging for the prediction of treatment failure in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee and conducted with informed written consent in patients with primary HNSCC treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. DW imaging of the primary tumor was performed before treatment in 37 patients and was repeated within 2 weeks of treatment in 30 patients. Histograms of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were analyzed, and mean ADC, kurtosis, skewness, and their respective percentage change were correlated for local failure and local control at 2 years by using the Student t test. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the ADC parameters, T stage, and tumor volume were performed by using logistic regression for prediction of local failure. RESULTS: Local failure occurred in 16 of 37 (43%) patients and local control occurred in 21 of 37 (57%) patients. Pretreatment ADC parameters showed no correlation with local failure. There was significant intratreatment increase in mean ADC and a decrease in skewness and kurtosis (P < .001, P < .001, P = .024, respectively) for the whole group of patients when compared with those before treatment. During treatment, primary tumors showed a significantly lower increase in percentage change of mean ADC, higher skewness, and higher kurtosis for local failure than for local control (P = .016, .015, and .040, respectively). These ADC parameters also were significant for predicting local failure with use of univariate but not multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Early intratreatment DW imaging has the potential to allow prediction of treatment response at the primary site in patients with HNSCC.",

RESULTS: The mean FA of all ROIs was 0.468 +/- 0.014 (SD) (controls) or 0.431 +/- 0.029 (MS group) (P = 0.016). Mean ADC was 0.785 +/- 0.034 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (controls) or 0.805 +/- 0.041 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (MS group). The mean DK of all ROIs was 0.878 +/- 0.020 (controls) or 0.823 +/- 0.032 (MS group) (P = 0.002). Analysis of individual ROIs revealed significant differences in DK in 3 ROIs between normal WM and NAWM, but significant differences in ADC and FA in only one ROI each. CONCLUSION: DKI may be a new sensitive indicator for detecting tissue damage in MS patients in addition to conventional diffusional evaluations, for example diffusion tensor imaging.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four healthy volunteers participated in this study. Standard DKI and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) DKI experiments were performed using a twice-refocused-spin-echo diffusion sequence. The conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, D[symbol in text], D[symbol in text] together with DKI metrics of mean, axial, and radial kurtosis (MK, K[symbol in text], K[symbol in text], were measured and compared. Single image slices located above the lateral ventricles, with similar anatomical features for each subject, were selected to minimize the effect of CSF from the ventricles. RESULTS: In white matter, differences of less than 10% were observed between diffusion metrics measured with standard DKI and FLAIR-DKI sequences, suggesting minimal CSF contamination. For gray matter, conventional DTI metrics differed by 19% to 52%, reflecting significant CSF partial volume effects. Kurtosis metrics, however, changed by 11% or less, indicating greater robustness with respect to CSF contamination. CONCLUSION: Kurtosis metrics are less sensitive to CSF partial voluming in cortical gray matter than conventional diffusion metrics. The kurtosis metrics may then be more specific indicators of changes in tissue microstructure, provided the effect sizes for the changes are comparable.",

Kurtosis is used to measure the deviation of water diffusion from Gaussian model, which is called non-Gaussian, in DKI. However, the high-order kurtosis tensor in the model brings great difficulties in feature extraction. In this study, parameters like fractional anisotropy of kurtosis eigenvalues (FAek) and mean values of kurtosis eigenvalues (Mek) were proposed, and regional analysis was performed for 4 different tissues: corpus callosum, crossing fibers, thalamus, and cerebral cortex, compared with other parameters. Scatterplot analysis and Gaussian mixture decomposition of different parametric maps are used for tissues identification. Diffusion kurtosis information extracted from kurtosis tensor presented a more detailed classification of tissues actually as well as clinical significance, and the FAek of D-eigenvalues showed good sensitivity of tissues complexity which is important for further study of DKI.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite being the gold standard technique for stroke assessment, conventional diffusion MRI provides only partial information about tissue microstructure. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is an advanced diffusion MRI method that yields, in addition to conventional diffusion information, the diffusional kurtosis, which may help improve characterization of tissue microstructure. In particular, this additional information permits the description of white matter (WM) in terms of WM-specific diffusion metrics. The goal of this study is to elucidate possible biophysical mechanisms underlying ischemia using these new WM metrics. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical and diffusional kurtosis imaging data of 44 patients with acute/subacute ischemic stroke. Patients with a history of brain neoplasm or intracranial hemorrhages were excluded from this study. Region of interest analysis was performed to measure percent change of diffusion metrics in ischemic WM lesions compared with the contralateral hemisphere. RESULTS: Kurtosis maps exhibit distinct ischemic lesion heterogeneity that is not apparent on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Kurtosis metrics also have significantly higher absolute percent change than complementary conventional diffusion metrics. Our WM metrics reveal an increase in axonal density and a larger decrease in the intra-axonal (Da) compared with extra-axonal diffusion microenvironment of the ischemic WM lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of WM after ischemia is found to be mainly driven by a significant drop in the intra-axonal diffusion microenvironment. Our results suggest that ischemia preferentially alters intra-axonal environment, consistent with a proposed mechanism of focal enlargement of axons known as axonal swelling or beading.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The non-gaussian (NG)-IVIM model was developed and tested on diffusion-weighted MRI data collected on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner from eight patients with head and neck cancer. Voxel-wise parameter quantification was performed by using a noise-rectified least-square fitting method. The NG-IVIM, IVIM, Kurtosis, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) models were used for comparison. For each voxel, within the metastatic node, the optimal model was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The voxel percentage preferred by each model was calculated and the optimal model map was generated. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision dependency of the new model. RESULTS: For the eight neck nodes, the range of voxel percentage preferred by the NG-IVIM model was 2.3-79.3%. The optimal modal maps showed heterogeneities within the tumors. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the accuracy and precision of the NG-IVIM model improved by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and b value. CONCLUSION: The NG-IVIM model characterizes perfusion and restricted diffusion simultaneously in neck nodal metastases.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate which mathematical model (monoexponential, biexponential, statistical, kurtosis) fits best to the diffusion-weighted signal in prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 prostate 3-T MRI examinations of young volunteers (YV, n=8), patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer (PC, n=8) and an aged matched control group (AC, n=8) were included. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using 11 b-values ranging from 0 to 800 s/mm(2). RESULTS: Monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were significantly (P<.001) lower in the peripheral (PZ) zone (1.18+/-0.16 mm(2)/s) and the central (CZ) zone (0.73+/-0.13 mm(2)/s) of YV compared to AC (PZ 1.92+/-0.17 mm(2)/s; CZ 1.35+/-0.21 mm(2)/s). In PC ADC(mono) values (0.61+/-0.06 mm(2)/s) were significantly (P<.001) lower than in the peripheral of central zone of AC. Using the statistical analysis (Akaike information criteria) in YV most pixels were best described by the biexponential model (82%), the statistical model, respectively kurtosis (93%) each compared to the monoexponential model. In PC the majority of pixels was best described by the monoexponential model (57%) compared to the biexponential model. CONCLUSION: Although a more complex model might provide a better fitting when multiple b-values are used, the monoexponential analyses for ADC calculation in prostate MRI is sufficient to discriminate prostate cancer from normal tissue using b-values ranging from 0 to 800 s/mm(2).",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVES: The objective was to perform ex vivo evaluation of non-Gaussian diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including presence of treatment-related necrosis, using fresh liver explants. METHODS: Twelve liver explants underwent 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging using a DKI sequence with maximal b-value of 2000 s/mm(2). A standard monoexponential fit was used to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and a non-Gaussian kurtosis fit was used to calculate K, a measure of excess kurtosis of diffusion, and D, a corrected diffusion coefficient accounting for this non-Gaussian behavior. The mean value of these parameters was measured for 16 HCCs based upon histologic findings. For each metric, HCC-to-liver contrast was calculated, and coefficient of variation (CV) was computed for voxels within the lesion as an indicator of heterogeneity. A single hepatopathologist determined HCC necrosis and cellularity. RESULTS: The 16 HCCs demonstrated intermediate-to-substantial excess diffusional kurtosis, and mean corrected diffusion coefficient D was 23% greater than mean ADC (P=.002). HCC-to-liver contrast and CV of HCC were greater for K than ADC or D, although these differences were significant only for CV of HCCs (P</=.046). ADC, D and K all showed significant differences between non-, partially and completely necrotic HCCs (P</=.004). Among seven nonnecrotic HCCs, cellularity showed a strong inverse correlation with ADC (r=-0.80), a weaker inverse correlation with D (-0.24) and a direct correlation with K (r=0.48). CONCLUSIONS: We observed non-Gaussian diffusion behavior for HCCs ex vivo; this DKI model may have added value in HCC characterization in comparison with a standard monoexponential model of diffusion-weighted imaging.",

        "AB": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: A histologic grade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is clinically important because of its association with prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of histographic analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume in differentiating histologic grades in HNSCC at standard (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) and high (b = 2000 s/mm(2)) b values. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with HNSCC, including well-differentiated (WD; n = 35), moderately differentiated (MD; n = 13) and poorly differentiated (PD; n = 6) carcinomas, were retrospectively evaluated. ADC maps were obtained at two different b values (1000 and 2000 s/mm(2)) in each patient. Tumors were delineated on each slice of ADC maps, and data were collected to obtain a histogram for the entire tumor volume. Histographic parameters were calculated, including mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and the ratio of the kurtosis measured at b values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm(2). These parameters were correlated with histologic grades. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between tumor grades and histographic parameters obtained from ADC maps at b = 1000 s/mm(2). However, mean ADC at b = 2000 s/mm(2) was significantly higher in WD HNSCC (881 +/- 131 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s) than in MD and PD HNSCC (770 +/- 163 and 780 +/- 158 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, respectively) (P < .05). Kurtosis ratio was significantly higher in PD HNSCC (115 +/- 10%) compared to WD and MD HNSCC (91 +/- 21% and 86 +/- 26%, respectively) (P < .05). Diagnostic accuracy was 100%, 76.9%, and 65.8% for PD, MD, and WD HNSCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Histographic analysis of ADC maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume can be useful in differentiating histologic grades of HNSCC using mean ADC at b = 2000 s/mm(2) and kurtosis ratio.",

Our study examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of diffusion kurtosis imaging in an animal model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (N=18) were subjected to 90 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion. Multiparametric MR images were obtained during middle cerebral artery occlusion and 20 minutes after reperfusion with diffusion-weighted MRI obtained using 8 b-values from 250 to 3000 s/mm(2) in 6 diffusion gradient directions. Diffusion and kurtosis lesions were outlined in shuffled images by 2 investigators independently. T(2) MRI was obtained 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion to evaluate stroke outcome. RESULTS: Mean diffusion lesion (23.5%+/-8.1%, percentage of the brain slice) was significantly larger than mean kurtosis lesion (13.2%+/-2.0%) during middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mean diffusion lesion decreased significantly after reperfusion (13.8%+/-4.3%), whereas mean kurtosis lesion showed little change (13.0%+/-2.5%) with their lesion size difference being insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that mean diffusion/mean kurtosis mismatch recovered reasonably well on reperfusion, whereas regions with concurrent mean diffusion and mean kurtosis deficits showed poor recovery. Diffusion kurtosis imaging may help stratify heterogeneous diffusion-weighted MRI lesions for enhanced characterization of ischemic tissue injury.",

        "AB": "An important focus of Huntington Disease (HD) research is the identification of symptom-independent biomarkers of HD neuropathology. There is an urgent need for reproducible, sensitive and specific outcome measures, which can be used to track disease onset as well as progression. Neuroimaging studies, in particular diffusion-based MRI methods, are powerful probes for characterizing the effects of disease and aging on tissue microstructure. We report novel diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) findings in aged transgenic HD rats. We demonstrate altered diffusion metrics in the (pre)frontal cerebral cortex, external capsule and striatum. Presence of increased diffusion complexity and restriction in the striatum is confirmed by an increased fiber dispersion in this region. Immunostaining of the same specimens reveals decreased number of microglia in the (pre)frontal cortex, and increased numbers of oligodendrocytes in the striatum. We conclude that DKI allows sensitive and specific characterization of altered tissue integrity in this HD rat model, indicating a promising potential for diagnostic imaging of gray and white matter pathology.",

        "AB": "In this preliminary study, we aimed to investigate the abnormalities of water diffusion in children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eight children with unilateral TLE (according to electroencephalography, EEG) and eight age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)/diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) acquisitions were performed. Radial diffusivity (lambda( perpendicular)), axial diffusivity (lambda( parallel)), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated for both DTI and DKI, and radial kurtosis (K( perpendicular)), axial kurtosis (K( parallel)) and mean kurtosis (MK) maps were calculated for DKI only. Mann-Whitney test showed that, for white matter in the temporal lobe, DKI-derived lambda( parallel) , MD and K( parallel) were significantly different in bilateral temporal lobes and EEG-abnormal and EEG-normal sides of the temporal lobe between patients and controls, whereas DTI showed no abnormalities. For gray matter, DKI detected significantly higher MD and MK in the same three comparisons, whereas DTI detected abnormalities only in the comparison between bilateral temporal lobes and between EEG-normal sides in cases and left-right matched sides in controls. No significant difference was observed between EEG-abnormal and EEG-normal sides in cases. These preliminary results indicate that DKI is more sensitive than DTI for the detection of diffusion abnormalities in the temporal lobes of children with TLE, even when EEG signals are normal. These findings pave the way for the application of DKI for in-depth studies on TLE in children.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study and waived informed consent. Forty-seven patients with prostate cancer underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging by using a pelvic phased-array coil and DW imaging (maximum b value, 2000 sec/mm2). Parametric maps were obtained for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); the metric DK (K), which represents non-Gaussian diffusion behavior; and corrected diffusion (D) that accounts for this non-Gaussianity. Two radiologists reviewed these maps and measured ADC, D, and K in sextants positive for cancer at biopsy. Data were analyzed by using mixed-model analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Seventy sextants exhibited a Gleason score of 6; 51 exhibited a Gleason score of 7 or 8. K was significantly greater in cancerous sextants than in benign PZ (0.96+/-0.24 vs 0.57+/-0.07, P<.001), as well as in cancerous sextants with higher rather than lower Gleason score (1.05+/-0.26 vs 0.89+/-0.20, P<.001). K showed significantly greater sensitivity for differentiating cancerous sextants from benign PZ than ADC or D (93.3% vs 78.5% and 83.5%, respectively; P<.001), with equal specificity (95.7%, P>.99). K exhibited significantly greater sensitivity for differentiating sextants with low- and high-grade cancer than ADC or D (68.6% vs 51.0% and 49.0%, respectively; P</=.004) but with decreased specificity (70.0% vs 81.4% and 82.9%, respectively; P</=.023). K had significantly greater area under the curve for differentiating sextants with low- and high-grade cancer than ADC (0.70 vs 0.62, P=.010). Relative contrast between cancerous sextants and benign PZ was significantly greater for D or K than ADC (0.25+/-0.14 and 0.24+/-0.13, respectively, vs 0.18+/-0.10; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings suggest increased value for DK imaging compared with standard DW imaging in prostate cancer assessment.",

The affected regions were predominantly in grey rather than in white matter. The parameter maps were constructed for metrics quantifying the apparent diffusivity (evaluated from conventional diffusion tensor imaging, DKI and LNDFI) and for those quantifying the degree of deviations (mean kurtosis and a parameter sigma characterising the width of the distribution). We showed that both DKI and LNDFI were able to dramatically enhance the visualisation of ischaemic lesions in comparison with conventional methods. The largest relative change in the affected versus healthy regions was observed in the mean kurtosis values. The average changes in the mean kurtosis and sigma values in the lesions were a factor of two to three larger than the relative changes observed in the mean diffusivity. In conclusion, the applied methods promise valuable perspectives in the assessment of stroke.",

        "AB": "Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), which measures the non-Gaussianity of water diffusion, has been demonstrated to be a sensitive biomarker in many neuropathologies. The goal of this study was to longitudinally examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of DKI in cerebral ischemia in an animal model of permanent and transient (45 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) during the hyperacute, acute and chronic phases. Diffusional kurtosis showed different spatiotemporal dynamics. In particular, mean kurtosis (MK) was sensitive to hyperacute and acute stroke changes, and exhibited different contrast than mean diffusivity (MD) and higher contrast than fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2. MK contrast persisted 1 to 7 days post-occlusion, whereas MD showed renormalization at day 1-2 and reversed contrast at day 7. The current study showed that DKI has the potential to complement existing stroke imaging techniques, particularly in the assessment of subacute to early chronic stroke evolution.",

        "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the use of root mean square displacement (RMSD) and mean diffusional kurtosis (DK) metrics of q-space imaging data to estimate spinal cord compression in patients with early cervical spondylosis. METHODS: We studied 50 consecutive patients at our institution (22 male, 28 female; mean age 58 years; age range 20-86 years) who had clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of early clinical stage cervical myelopathy. After conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, diffusion tensor and q-space image data were acquired using 3-T MR imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), RMSD and mean DK values were calculated and compared between compressed and uncompressed spinal cords. RESULTS: FA and mean DK values were significantly lower and RMSD was significantly higher (P = 0.0060, 0.0020 and 0.0062, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test with the Bonferroni correction) in compressed spinal cords than in uncompressed cords. ADC was also higher in compressed cords, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of spinal cord damage in early cervical spondylosis, mean DK and RMSD values in the spinal cord may be highly sensitive indicators of microstructural change and damage. KEY POINTS: * Absolute surgical indications for cervical spondylosis with myelopathy remain to be established. * Diffusion tensor MRI shows abnormalities in normal-appearing but compressed spinal cord. * Non-Gaussian diffusion analysis is highly sensitive in revealing spinal cord damage.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this prospective study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Diffusion parameters-mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis, and radial and axial kurtosis-were compared in the solid parts of 17 high-grade gliomas and 11 low-grade gliomas (P<.05 significance level, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction). MD, FA, mean kurtosis, radial kurtosis, and axial kurtosis in solid tumors were also normalized to the corresponding values in contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and the contralateral posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) after age correction and were compared among tumor grades. RESULTS: Mean, radial, and axial kurtosis were significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas (P = .02, P = .015, and P = .01, respectively). FA and MD did not significantly differ between glioma grades. All values, except for axial kurtosis, that were normalized to the values in the contralateral NAWM were significantly different between high-grade and low-grade gliomas (mean kurtosis, P = .02; radial kurtosis, P = .03; FA, P = .025; and MD, P = .03). When values were normalized to those in the contralateral PLIC, none of the considered parameters showed significant differences between high-grade and low-grade gliomas. The highest sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between high-grade and low-grade gliomas were found for mean kurtosis (71% and 82%, respectively) and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM (100% and 73%, respectively). Optimal thresholds for mean kurtosis and mean kurtosis normalized to the value in the contralateral NAWM for differentiating high-grade from low-grade gliomas were 0.52 and 0.51, respectively. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in kurtosis parameters between high-grade and low-grade gliomas; hence, better separation was achieved with these parameters than with conventional diffusion imaging parameters.",

        "AB": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging provides access to fiber pathways and structural integrity in fibrous tissues such as white matter in the brain. In order to enable better access to the sensitivity of the diffusion indices to the underlying microstructure, it is important to develop artificial model systems that exhibit a well-known structure, on the one hand, but benefit from a reduced complexity on the other hand. In this work, we developed a novel multisection diffusion phantom made of polyethylene fibers tightly wound on an acrylic support. The phantom exhibits three regions with different geometrical configuration of fibers: a region with fibers crossing at right angles, a region with parallel fibers and homogeneous density, and, finally, a region with parallel fibers but with a gradient of fiber density along the axis of symmetry. This gives rise to a gradual change of the degree of anisotropy within the same phantom. In this way, the need to construct several phantoms with different fiber densities is avoided, and one can access different fractional anisotropies in the same experiment under the same physical conditions. The properties of the developed phantom are demonstrated by means of diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging. The measurements were performed using a diffusion-weighted spin-echo and a diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo pulse sequence programmed in-house. The influence of the fiber density packing on the diffusion parameters was analyzed. We also demonstrate how the novel phantom can be used for the validation of high angular resolution diffusion imaging data analysis.",

To show this capability, we have investigated DKI images of a healthy subject and a patient with white matter lesions. The analysis was performed both between and within subjects. Regions of Interest (ROIs) for lesion and normal white matter in the patient images are selected manually (for within subject study) and also the corresponding ROIs in the healthy subject are defined (for between subject study). The results of comparing the estimated values for apparent diffusion and kurtosis parameters show that both D(app) and K(app) can distinguish normal and abnormal tissues. K(app) (D(app)) of the normal regions is greater (lower) than that of the abnormal regions. Another investigation over all voxels in the brain shows an important feature of kurtosis in determining white matter lesions.",

        "AB": "The diffusional kurtosis is an indicator for diffusion restrictions in biological tissue. It is observed experimentally that the kurtosis is largest for directions perpendicular to the fiber direction in white matter. The directional dependence of the kurtosis can be described by the diffusion kurtosis tensor. Since the intention of diffusion kurtosis imaging is to detect diffusion restrictions, the fit of the kurtosis tensor should be dominated by directions perpendicular to the fibers. In this work, it is shown that the basic approach, which is solving the occurring linear system by a pseudoinverse matrix, may completely fail in this regard if the diffusion is highly anisotropic. This problem is solved by adapting the weights of the fit--and thus emphasizing directions of restricted water motion--using a direct fit of the kurtosis tensor to the measured kurtosis values. Moreover, due to its large number of degrees of freedom, the kurtosis tensor can assume complicated shapes resulting in a fit which is sensitive to noise. This article demonstrates that the quality of the kurtosis tensor calculation can be further improved if the fit is regularized by suppressing too large and too small kurtosis tensor values and thus restricting the possible tensor shapes.",

        "AB": "Dairy cream is shown to be a simple, inexpensive, isotropic phantom useful for testing diffusional kurtosis imaging data acquisition and postprocessing. The MR-visible protons of cream exhibit slow and fast diffusion components, attributed to the fat and water protons, respectively, which give rise to a diffusion coefficient of 1.1 mum(2)/ms and a diffusional kurtosis of 1.2. These parameter values are similar to those observed in vivo for human brain. Heating the cream is found to increase the T(2)-relaxation time of the fat protons, which facilitates the evaluation of typical diffusional kurtosis imaging protocols used in clinical settings. The diffusion coefficient and diffusional kurtosis can both be measured directly and predicted based on the corresponding diffusion parameters of the individual water and fat components, which are independently measurable due to chemical shift misregistration, thus providing an important consistency check. This phantom is proposed as a convenient calibration standard for multicenter diffusional kurtosis imaging studies.",

        "AB": "OBJECT: The aim of this work was to understand biophysical substrate underpinning contrast in diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) in white matter, using the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A theoretical relationship between the kurtosis function K and the CHARMED parameters, i.e., the restricted volume fraction RF and the axonal longitudinal diffusivity D was derived for the propagator used in the CHARMED model. Evidence for a similar correlation between these measures was then investigated in vivo across different WM regions in five healthy young subjects that underwent a CHARMED protocol at 3T. RESULTS: Our theoretical treatment shows that K has an increasing trend for both increasing RF values and increasing D. In vivo, a significant positive correlation (P < 0.001) was found between the kurtosis orthogonal to the fibre orientation K ( perpendicular) and RF. A multilinear regression showed that K ( perpendicular) values are better explained by a mixed contribution of both RF and D. CONCLUSIONS: The CHARMED model was used to understand whether and where DKI contrast can be explained in terms of the underlying axonal geometry. This work demonstrates that the information contained in DKI overlaps with the information extracted by CHARMED in areas of higher intra-voxel directional coherence.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Nine atypical, three anaplastic, and 39 typical meningiomas were retrospectively studied. The 39 typical meningiomas included one secretory meningioma and 11 fibroblastic, 11 transitional, 14 meningothelial, and two angiomatous meningiomas. DT imaging metrics, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, linear anisotropy coefficient, planar anisotropy coefficient (CP), spherical anisotropy coefficient (CS), and eigenvalue skewness (SK), as well as normalized signal intensity from contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images, were measured from the enhancing region of the tumor. Mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis were extracted from the histograms. A two-level decision tree was designed, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used at each level to determine the best model for classification. RESULTS: Histogram skewness of SK and kurtosis of SK were significantly higher in atypical and anaplastic meningiomas than in typical meningiomas (P<.01). Among typical meningiomas, significant differences in histogram measures of CP and CS between fibroblastic meningiomas and other subtypes were observed (P<.01). The best model for differentiating atypical and anaplastic meningiomas from typical meningiomas consisted of mean and skewness of SK and kurtosis of T1 signal intensity, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.946. The best model for differentiating fibroblastic meningiomas from other subtypes consisted of skewness of T2 signal intensity and kurtosis of CP (AUC, 0.970). CONCLUSION: Histogram analysis of DT imaging metrics can help determine the grades and subtypes of meningiomas, which can better assist in surgical planning.",

        "AB": "We developed a novel method to accelerate diffusion spectrum imaging using compressed sensing. The method can be applied to either reduce acquisition time of diffusion spectrum imaging acquisition without losing critical information or to improve the resolution in diffusion space without increasing scan time. Unlike parallel imaging, compressed sensing can be applied to reconstruct a sub-Nyquist sampled dataset in domains other than the spatial one. Simulations of fiber crossings in 2D and 3D were performed to systematically evaluate the effect of compressed sensing reconstruction with different types of undersampling patterns (random, gaussian, Poisson disk) and different acceleration factors on radial and axial diffusion information. Experiments in brains of healthy volunteers were performed, where diffusion space was undersampled with different sampling patterns and reconstructed using compressed sensing. Essential information on diffusion properties, such as orientation distribution function, diffusion coefficient, and kurtosis is preserved up to an acceleration factor of R = 4.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen tumors in a rat model were imaged on a clinical 3T system before and 72 hours after a single RT session. Diffusion imaging was performed using an echo planar sequence containing 16 b-factors and six gradient directions. This allowed us to perform a tensor analysis of mono- and biexponential decays and a q-space analysis. Parametric maps (both trace and fractional anisotropy) were reconstructed for: 2-point apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), 16-point ADC, biexponential amplitudes and ADCs, and height, width, and kurtosis of the probability density function (PDF). A texture analysis yielded quantities such as average and contrast. The sensitivity of diffusion-related parameters was quantified in terms of the mean relative difference (when comparing pre- and post-RT status). RESULTS: Traces and anisotropies display differences in response to RT. Average traces are most sensitive for ADCs and kurtosis. Average anisotropies are all very sensitive except the slow biexponential component. The best contrast (traces) was found for the ADCs and the width of the PDF. CONCLUSION: ADC performed well, but high b-values analysis added extra sensitive parameters for monitoring early RT-induced changes.",

        "AB": "Huntington Disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, caused by a mutation in the Huntington gene. Although HD is most often diagnosed in mid-life, the key to its clinical expression may be found during brain maturation. In the present work, we performed in vivo diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in order to study brain microstructure alterations in developing transgenic HD rat pups. Several developing brain regions, relevant for HD pathology (caudate putamen, cortex, corpus callosum, external capsule and anterior commissure anterior), were examined at postnatal days 15 (P15) and 30 (P30), and DKI results were validated with histology. At P15, we observed higher mean (MD) and radial (RD) diffusivity values in the cortex of transgenic HD rat pups. In addition, at the age of P30, lower axial kurtosis (AK) values in the caudate putamen of transgenic HD pups were found. At the level of the external capsule, higher MD values at P15 but lower MD and AD values at P30 were detected. The observed DKI results have been confirmed by myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry, which revealed a reduced fiber staining as well as less ordered fibers in transgenic HD rat pups. These results indicate that neuronal development in young transgenic HD rat pups occurs differently compared to controls and that the presence of mutant huntingtin has an influence on postnatal brain development. In this context, various diffusivity parameters estimated by the DKI model are a powerful tool to assess changes in tissue microstructure and detect developmental changes in young transgenic HD rat pups.",

        "AB": "Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) provides quantifiable information on the non-Gaussian behavior of water diffusion in biological tissue. Changes in water diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and DKI parameters in several white and gray matter regions were investigated in a mild controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury rat model at both the acute (2 h) and the sub-acute (7 days) stages following injury. Mixed model ANOVA analysis revealed significant changes in temporal patterns of both DTI and DKI parameters in the cortex, hippocampus, external capsule and corpus callosum. Post-hoc tests indicated acute changes in mean diffusivity (MD) in the bilateral cortex and hippocampus (p<0.0005) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in ipsilateral cortex (p<0.0005), hippocampus (p=0.014), corpus callosum (p=0.031) and contralateral external capsule (p=0.011). These changes returned to baseline by the sub-acute stage. However, mean kurtosis (MK) was significantly elevated at the sub-acute stages in all ipsilateral regions and scaled inversely with the distance from the impacted site (cortex and corpus callosum: p<0.0005; external capsule: p=0.003; hippocampus: p=0.011). Further, at the sub-acute stage increased MK was also observed in the contralateral regions compared to baseline (cortex: p=0.032; hippocampus: p=0.039) while no change was observed with MD and FA. An increase in mean kurtosis was associated with increased reactive astrogliosis from immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results suggest that DKI is sensitive to microstructural changes associated with reactive astrogliosis which may be missed by standard DTI parameters alone. Monitoring changes in MK allows the investigation of molecular and morphological changes in vivo due to reactive astrogliosis and may complement information available from standard DTI parameters. To date the use of diffusion tensor imaging has been limited to study changes in white matter integrity following traumatic insults. Given the sensitivity of DKI to detect microstructural changes even in the gray matter in vivo, allows the extension of the technique to understand patho-morphological changes in the whole brain following a traumatic insult.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms in the prediction of chemotherapy response in patients with metastatic ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Research ethics committee approval and patient written informed consent were obtained. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis before and after one and three cycles of chemotherapy in 42 women (mean age, 63.0 years +/- 11.4 [standard deviation]) with newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Reproducibility and intra- and interobserver agreement of ADC calculations were assessed. Per-patient weighted ADC histograms were generated at each time point from pixel ADCs from five or fewer target lesions. Mean ADC, percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th), skew, kurtosis, and their change were analyzed according to histologic grade, primary versus recurrent disease status, and response, determined with integrated biochemical and morphologic criteria, with a linear mixed model. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for combinations of parameters were calculated with linear discriminant analysis. Results: Coefficients of variation for repeat measurements and for within and between observers were 4.8%, 11.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Grade and disease status did not significantly affect histogram parameters. Pretreatment ADCs were not predictive of response. In responders, all ADCs increased after the first and third cycle (P < .001), while skew and kurtosis decreased after the third (P < .001 and P = .006, respectively); however, in nonresponders, no parameter changed significantly. Percentage change of the 25th percentile performed best in identifying response (AUC = 0.82 and 0.83 after first and third cycle, respectively), whereas combination of parameters did not improve accuracy. CONCLUSION: An early increase of ADCs and later decrease of skew and kurtosis characterize chemotherapy response. Quantitative DW MR imaging can aid in early monitoring of treatment efficacy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Examinations were performed with the understanding and written consent of each subject, with local ethics committee approval, and in compliance with national legislation and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 30 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 64.5 years +/- 3.4 [standard deviation]) and 30 healthy subjects (mean age, 65.0 years +/- 5.1). Mean kurtosis, fractional anisotropy, and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity of the basal ganglia were compared between the groups. Disease severity was assessed by using Hoehn and Yahr staging and the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mean scores, 2.0 and 33.6, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to correlate imaging findings with disease severity. RESULTS: Mean kurtosis in the putamen was higher in the PD group (0.93 +/- 0.15) than in the control group (0.71 +/- 0.09) (P < .000416). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95 for both the ipsilateral putamen and the ipsilateral substantia nigra. The mean kurtosis for the ipsilateral substantia nigra had the best diagnostic performance (mean cutoff, 1.10; sensitivity, 0.92; specificity, 0.87). In contrast, AUCs for the tensor-derived indexes ranged between 0.43 (axial and radial diffusivity in substantia nigra) and 0.65 (fractional anisotropy in substantia nigra). CONCLUSION: Diffusion kurtosis imaging in the basal ganglia, as compared with conventional diffusion-tensor imaging, can improve the diagnosis of PD.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Repeated exposure to mild stressors induces anhedonia-a core symptom of major depressive disorder-in up to 70% of the stress-exposed rats, whereas the remaining show resilience to stress. This chronic mild stress (CMS) model is well documented as an animal model of major depressive disorder. We examined the morphological, microstructural, and metabolic characteristics of the hippocampus in anhedonic and stress resilient rats that may mark the differential behavioral outcome. METHODS: Anhedonic (n = 8), resilient (n = 8), and control (n = 8) rats were subjected to in vivo diffusion kurtosis imaging, high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Diffusion kurtosis parameters were decreased in both CMS-exposed groups. A significant inward displacement in the ventral part of the right hippocampus was apparent in the resilient subjects and an increase of the glutamate:total creatine ratio and N-acetylaspartylglutamate:total creatine was observed in the anhedonic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion kurtosis imaging discloses subtle substructural changes in the hippocampus of CMS-exposed animals irrespective of their anhedonic or resilient nature. In contrast, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging-based shape change analysis of the hippocampus allowed discrimination of these two subtypes of stress sensitivity. Although the precise mechanism discriminating their behavior is yet to be elucidated, the present study underlines the role of the hippocampus in the etiology of depression and the induction of anhedonia. Our results reflect the potency of noninvasive magnetic resonance methods in preclinical settings with key translational benefit to and from the clinic.",

        "AB": "Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a clinically feasible extension of diffusion tensor imaging that probes restricted water diffusion in biological tissues using magnetic resonance imaging. Here we provide a physically meaningful interpretation of DKI metrics in white matter regions consisting of more or less parallel aligned fiber bundles by modeling the tissue as two non-exchanging compartments, the intra-axonal space and extra-axonal space. For the b-values typically used in DKI, the diffusion in each compartment is assumed to be anisotropic Gaussian and characterized by a diffusion tensor. The principal parameters of interest for the model include the intra- and extra-axonal diffusion tensors, the axonal water fraction and the tortuosity of the extra-axonal space. A key feature is that these can be determined directly from the diffusion metrics conventionally obtained with DKI. For three healthy young adults, the model parameters are estimated from the DKI metrics and shown to be consistent with literature values. In addition, as a partial validation of this DKI-based approach, we demonstrate good agreement between the DKI-derived axonal water fraction and the slow diffusion water fraction obtained from standard biexponential fitting to high b-value diffusion data. Combining the proposed WM model with DKI provides a convenient method for the clinical assessment of white matter in health and disease and could potentially provide important information on neurodegenerative disorders.",

While diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can help to detect diffuse axonal injury (DAI), it is a limited indicator of tissue complexity. It has also been suggested that the thalamus may play an important role in the development of clinical sequelae in mTBI. The purpose of this study was to determine if diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), a novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, can provide early detection of damage in the thalamus and white matter (WM) of mTBI patients, and can help ascertain if thalamic injury is associated with cognitive impairment. Twenty-two mTBI patients and 14 controls underwent MRI and neuropsychological testing. Mean kurtosis (MK), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured in the thalamus and several WM regions classically identified with DAI. Compared to controls, patients examined within 1 year after injury exhibited variously altered DTI- and DKI-derived measures in the thalamus and the internal capsule, while in addition to these regions, patients examined more than 1 year after injury also showed similar differences in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the centrum semiovale. Cognitive impairment was correlated with MK in the thalamus and the internal capsule. These findings suggest that combined use of DTI and DKI provides a more sensitive tool for identifying brain injury. In addition, MK in the thalamus might be useful for early prediction of permanent brain damage and cognitive outcome.",

        "AB": "The departure from purely mono-exponential decay of the signal, as observed from brain tissue following a diffusion-sensitized sequence, has prompted the search for alternative models to characterize these unconventional water diffusion dynamics. Several approaches have been proposed in the last few years. While multi-exponential models have been applied to characterize brain tissue, several unresolved controversies about the interpretations of the results have motivated the search for alternative models that do not rely on the Gaussian diffusion hypothesis. In this brief review, diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and anomalous diffusion imaging (ADI) techniques are addressed and compared with diffusion tensor imaging. Theoretical and experimental issues are briefly described to allow readers to understand similarities, differences and limitations of these two non-Gaussian models. However, since the ultimate goal is to improve specificity, sensitivity and spatial localization of diffusion MRI for the detection of brain diseases, special attention will be paid on the clinical feasibility of the proposed techniques as well as on the context of brain pathology investigations.",

Since DWIs with different diffusion gradients produce dissimilar intensity contrasts, and since the distortion is nonlinear when multiple artifactual sources are intermixed, the mutual information-based affine registration may not be adequate for precise correction of distortions in DWIs, especially for images acquired with high b-values. To overcome these problems, we proposed an iterative image registration technique through which simulated DWIs are generated, driven from a diffusion tensor estimate, as targets for measured DWIs in the registration. Since simulated DWIs have similar intensity profiles to those of measured DWIs and the same geometric profiles as b(0)-images, an iterative procedure enables intensity-based nonlinear registration. As a pre-processing step, we also proposed a motion detection and sub-volume utilization for interleaved volumes. Performance evaluation with high b-valued DWIs for high angular resolution diffusion imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging showed that the proposed method had a superior advantage over the conventional registration technique.",

Our aim was to examine approaches capable of capturing more detailed information on the propagation mechanisms and underlying tissue microstructure in comparison to the conventional methods. In this work, we report a detailed in vivo diffusion study of the human brain in an extended range of the b-factors (up to 7000 s mm(-2)) performed on a group of 14 healthy volunteers at 3T. Combined diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and biexponential diffusion tensor analysis (BEDTA) were applied to quantify the attenuation curves. New quantitative indices are suggested as map parameters and are shown to improve the underlying structure contrast in comparison to conventional DTI. In particular, fractional anisotropy maps related to the slow diffusion tensor are shown to attain significantly higher values and to substantially improve white matter mapping. This is demonstrated for the specified regions of the frontal and occipital lobes and for the anterior cingulate. The findings of this work are substantiated by the statistical analysis of the whole slice histograms averaged over 14 subjects. Colour-coded directional maps related to the fast and slow diffusion tensors in human brain tissue are constructed for the first time and these demonstrate a high degree of axial co-alignment of the two tensors in the white matter regions. It is concluded that a combined DKI and BEDTA offers a promising framework for monitoring tissue alteration during development and degeneration or as a consequence of the neurological disease.",

        "AB": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced related methods such as diffusion spectrum and kurtosis imaging are limited by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at conventional field strengths. DTI at 7 T can provide increased SNR; however, B0 and B1 inhomogeneity and shorter T2 still pose formidable challenges. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare SNR at 7 and 3 T for different parallel imaging reduction factors, R, and TE, and to evaluate SNRs influences on fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). We found that R>4 at 7 T and R>/=2 at 3 T were needed to reduce geometric distortions due to B0 inhomogeneity. For these R at 7 T, SNR was 70-90 for b=0 s/mm(2) and 22-28 for b=1000s/mm(2) in central brain regions. SNR was lower at 3 T (40 for b=0 s/mm(2) and 15 for b=1000 s/mm(2)) and in lateral brain regions at 7 T due to B1 inhomogeneity. FA and ADC did not change with MRI field strength, SENSE factor or TE in the tested range. However, the coefficient of variation for FA increased for SNR <15 and for SNR <10 in ADC, consistent with published theoretical studies. Our study demonstrates that 7 T is advantageous for DTI and lays the groundwork for further development. Foremost, future work should further address challenges with B0 and B1 inhomogeneity to take full advantage for the increased SNR at 7 T.",

        "AB": "Hardware constraints typically require the use of extended gradient pulse durations for clinical applications of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can potentially influence the estimation of diffusion metrics. Prior studies have examined this effect for the apparent diffusion coefficient. This study employs a two-compartment exchange model in order to assess the gradient pulse duration sensitivity of the apparent diffusional kurtosis (ADK), a quantitative index of diffusional non-Gaussianity. An analytic expression is derived and numerically evaluated for parameter ranges relevant to DW-MRI of brain. It is found that the ADK differs from the true diffusional kurtosis by at most a few percent. This suggests that ADK estimates for brain may be robust with respect to changes in pulse gradient duration.",

We subjected male Wistar rats (n = 17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n = 9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n = 8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p < 0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T(2) in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, compared with FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FT and T(2) can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.",

The diffusion kurtosis imaging model quantifies the kurtosis, the degree of non-Gaussianity, on a direction dependent basis, constituting a higher order diffusion kurtosis tensor, which is estimated in addition to the well-known diffusion tensor. To reconcile with the physical phenomenon of molecular diffusion, both tensor estimates should lie within a physically acceptable range. Otherwise, clinically and artificially significant changes in diffusion (kurtosis) parameters might be confounded. To guarantee physical relevance, we here suggest to estimate both diffusional tensors by maximizing the joint likelihood function of all Rician distributed diffusion weighted images given the diffusion kurtosis imaging model while imposing a set of nonlinear constraints. As shown in this study, correctly accounting for the Rician noise structure is necessary to avoid significant overestimation of the kurtosis values. The performance of the constrained estimator was evaluated and compared to more commonly used strategies during simulations. Human brain data were used to emphasize the need for constrained estimators as not imposing the constraints give rise to constraint violations in about 70% of the brain voxels.",

        "AB": "This article presents two related advancements to the diffusional kurtosis imaging estimation framework to increase its robustness to noise, motion, and imaging artifacts. The first advancement substantially improves the estimation of diffusion and kurtosis tensors parameterizing the diffusional kurtosis imaging model. Rather than utilizing conventional unconstrained least squares methods, the tensor estimation problem is formulated as linearly constrained linear least squares, where the constraints ensure physically and/or biologically plausible tensor estimates. The exact solution to the constrained problem is found via convex quadratic programming methods or, alternatively, an approximate solution is determined through a fast heuristic algorithm. The computationally more demanding quadratic programming-based method is more flexible, allowing for an arbitrary number of diffusion weightings and different gradient sets for each diffusion weighting. The heuristic algorithm is suitable for real-time settings such as on clinical scanners, where run time is crucial. The advantage offered by the proposed constrained algorithms is demonstrated using in vivo human brain images. The proposed constrained methods allow for shorter scan times and/or higher spatial resolution for a given fidelity of the diffusional kurtosis imaging parametric maps. The second advancement increases the efficiency and accuracy of the estimation of mean and radial kurtoses by applying exact closed-form formulae.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To investigate non-Gaussian water diffusion using diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to assess age effects on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) microstructural changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to typically developing controls (TDC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and DKI images were acquired at 3T from TDC (n = 13) and adolescents with ADHD (n = 12). Regression analysis of the PFC region of interest (ROI) was conducted. RESULTS: TDC show a significant kurtosis increase of WM microstructural complexity from 12 to 18 years of age, particularly in the radial direction, whereas WM microstructure in ADHD is stagnant in both the axial and radial directions. In ADHD, GM microstructure also lacked a significant age-related increase in complexity as seen in TDC; only kurtosis measures were able to detect this difference. CONCLUSION: These findings support the prevailing theory that ADHD is a disorder affecting frontostriatal WM. Our study is the first to directly quantify an aberrant age-related trajectory in ADHD within GM microstructure, suggesting that the assessment of non-Gaussian directional diffusion using DKI provides more sensitive and complementary information about tissue microstructural changes than conventional diffusion imaging methods.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported abnormal functional connectivity patterns in the brains of people with autism that may be accompanied by decreases in white matter integrity. Since autism is a developmental disorder, we aim to investigate the nature and location of decreases in white and grey matter integrity in an adolescent sample while accounting for age. METHODS: We used structural (T1) imaging to study brain volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white and grey matter integrity in people with autism. We obtained magnetic resonance images for adolescents aged 12-18 years with high-functioning autism and from matched controls. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, as well as grey and white matter volumetrics were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 17 participants with autism and 25 matched controls included in this study. Participants with autism had lower fractional anisotropy in the left and right superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, but this effect was not significant after adjusting for age and intelligence quotient (IQ). The kurtosis of the white matter fractional anisotropy probability distribution was higher in this participant group, with and without adjustment for age and IQ. Most notably, however, the mean diffusivity levels were markedly increased in the autism group throughout the brain, and the mean diffusivity probability distributions of both grey and white matter were shifted toward a higher value, particularly with age and IQ adjustment. No volumetric differences in grey and white matter were found. Limitations: We corrected for age and IQ using a linear model. The study was also limited by its sample size, investigated age range and cross-sectional design. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that autism is characterized by a generalized reduction of white matter integrity that is associated with an increase of interstitial space. The generalized manifestation of the white matter abnormalities provides an important new perspective on autism as a connectivity disorder.",

        "AB": "By application of the MRI method of diffusional kurtosis imaging, a substantially increased diffusional kurtosis was observed within the cerebral ischemic lesions of three stroke subjects, 13-26 h following the onset of symptoms. This increase is interpreted as probably reflecting a higher degree of diffusional heterogeneity in the lesions when compared with normal-appearing contralateral tissue. In addition, for two of the subjects with white matter infarcts, the increase had a strong fiber tract orientational dependence. It is proposed that this effect is consistent with a large drop in the intra-axonal diffusivity, possibly related to either axonal varicosities or alterations associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.",

These blocks, such as cells or clusters of cells, can be much smaller than the imaging voxel, and are often comparable with the diffusion length. We have developed a general approach to quantify the medium heterogeneity when it is much finer than the sample size or the imaging resolution. The approach is based on the treatment of the medium statistically in terms of the correlation functions of the local parameters. The diffusion-weighted signal is explicity found for the case in which the local diffusivity varies in space, in the lowest order in the diffusivity variance. We demonstrate how the correlation length and the variance of the local diffusivity contribute to the time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the time-dependent kurtosis. Our results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in a two-dimensional heterogeneous medium.",

The estimated diffusion parameters, however, depend on the diffusion weighting strength, the b-value, which hampers the interpretation and comparison of various diffusion tensor imaging studies. In this study, a likelihood ratio test is used to show that the diffusion kurtosis imaging model provides a more accurate parameterization of both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion component compared with diffusion tensor imaging. As a result, the diffusion kurtosis imaging model provides a b-value-independent estimation of the widely used diffusion tensor parameters as demonstrated with diffusion-weighted rat data, which was acquired with eight different b-values, uniformly distributed in a range of [0,2800 sec/mm(2)]. In addition, the diffusion parameter values are significantly increased in comparison to the values estimated with the diffusion tensor imaging model in all major rat brain structures. As incorrectly assuming additive Gaussian noise on the diffusion-weighted data will result in an overestimated degree of non-Gaussian diffusion and a b-value-dependent underestimation of diffusivity measures, a Rician noise model was used in this study.",

Diffusional non-Gaussianity is a consequence of tissue structure that creates diffusion barriers and compartments. The degree of non-Gaussianity is conveniently quantified by the diffusional kurtosis and derivative metrics, such as the mean, axial, and radial kurtoses. DKI is a diffusion-weighted MRI technique that allows the diffusional kurtosis to be estimated with clinical scanners using standard diffusion-weighted pulse sequences and relatively modest acquisition times. DKI is an extension of the widely used diffusion tensor imaging method, but requires the use of at least 3 b-values and 15 diffusion directions. This review discusses the underlying theory of DKI as well as practical considerations related to data acquisition and post-processing. It is argued that the diffusional kurtosis is sensitive to diffusional heterogeneity and suggested that DKI may be useful for investigating ischemic stroke and neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.",

        "AB": "In conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), water diffusion distribution is described as a 2nd-order three-dimensional (3D) diffusivity tensor. It assumes that diffusion occurs in a free and unrestricted environment with a Gaussian distribution of diffusion displacement, and consequently that diffusion weighted (DW) signal decays with diffusion factor (b-value) monoexponentially. In biological tissue, complex cellular microstructures make water diffusion a highly hindered or restricted process. Non-monoexponential decays are experimentally observed in both white matter and gray matter. As a result, DTI quantitation is b-value dependent and DTI fails to fully utilize the diffusion measurements that are inherent to tissue microstructure. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) characterizes restricted diffusion and can be readily implemented on most clinical scanners. It provides a higher-order description of water diffusion process by a 2nd-order 3D diffusivity tensor as in conventional DTI together with a 4th-order 3D kurtosis tensor. Because kurtosis is a measure of the deviation of the diffusion displacement profile from a Gaussian distribution, DKI analyses quantify the degree of diffusion restriction or tissue complexity without any biophysical assumption. In this work, the theory of diffusion kurtosis and DKI including the directional kurtosis analysis is revisited. Several recent rodent DKI studies from our group are summarized, and DKI and DTI compared for their efficacy in detecting neural tissue alterations. They demonstrate that DKI offers a more comprehensive approach than DTI in describing the complex water diffusion process in vivo. By estimating both diffusivity and kurtosis, it may provide improved sensitivity and specificity in MR diffusion characterization of neural tissues.",

Results from q-space analysis (i.e., the diffusion probability density function) obtained with strong diffusion weighting were compared to conventional anisotropy and diffusivity measurements at low b-values, as well as to histology for axon and myelin damage. q-Space contrasts included the height (return to zero displacement probability), full width at half maximum, root mean square displacement, and kurtosis excess of the probability density function, which quantifies the deviation from gaussian diffusion. Following axotomy, a significant increase in perpendicular diffusion (with decreased kurtosis excess) and decrease in parallel diffusion (with increased kurtosis excess) were found in lesions relative to uninjured white matter. Notably, a significant change in abnormal parallel diffusion was detected from 3 to 30 days with full width at half maximum, but not with conventional diffusivity. Also, directional full width at half maximum and root mean square displacement measurements exhibited different sensitivities to white matter damage. When compared to histology, the increase in perpendicular diffusion was not specific to demyelination, whereas combined reduced parallel diffusion and increased perpendicular diffusion was associated with axon damage.",

METHODS: Measurements were performed in the rat thalamus for b = 200-3,200 s mm(-2), sweeping Delta between 20 and 100 ms at delta = 15 ms, and delta between 15 and 50 ms at Delta = 60 ms. Linear regressions were performed for each model parameter vs. Delta or delta. RESULTS: Increasing Delta from 20 to 100 ms increases D' (from 0.64 to 0.70 x 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1)) and D (slow) (from 0.26 to 0.33 x 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1)), reduces K (from 0.57 to 0.53), and has no effects on D (fast), f (slow) or D. Increasing delta from 15 to 50 ms increases D (from 0.80 to 0.88 x 10(-3) mm(2)s(-1)), and has no effects on the other parameters. CONCLUSION: The parameters of the biexponential and diffusional kurtosis models are more sensitive than the exponential model to Delta and delta; however, observed effects are too small to account for the discrepancies found in literature.",

        "AB": "Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) model that describes the non-Gaussian diffusion behavior in tissues. It has recently been shown that DKI parameters, such as the radial or axial kurtosis, are more sensitive to brain physiology changes than the well-known diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters in several white and gray matter structures. In order to estimate either DTI or DKI parameters with maximum precision, the diffusion weighting gradient settings that are applied during the acquisition need to be optimized. Indeed, it has been shown previously that optimizing the set of diffusion weighting gradient settings can have a significant effect on the precision with which DTI parameters can be estimated. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of DKI gradients settings. Commonly, DKI data are acquired using a standard set of diffusion weighting gradients with fixed directions and with regularly spaced gradient strengths. In this paper, we show that such gradient settings are suboptimal with respect to the precision with which DKI parameters can be estimated. Furthermore, the gradient directions and the strengths of the diffusion-weighted MR images are optimized by minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound of DKI parameters. The impact of the optimized gradient settings is evaluated, both on simulated as well as experimentally recorded datasets. It is shown that the precision with which the kurtosis parameters can be estimated, increases substantially by optimizing the gradient settings.",

        "AB": "Purpose: To characterize the non-Gaussian diffusion patterns of cerebral glioma microstructure with respect to the different glioma grades by using a new method called diffusional kurtosis (DK) imaging. Materials and Methods: In this study with institutional review board approval and patient consent, diffusional measures of mean kurtosis (MK), fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were compared prospectively. Data were normalized to the contralateral white matter. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare each histologic glioma subtype regarding the diffusion measurements. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to test for the parameter with the best sensitivity and specificity for glioma grade discrimination. Results: In 34 patients with cerebral gliomas (five World Health Organization [WHO] grade II astrocytomas, 13 WHO grade III astrocytomas, and 16 WHO grade IV glioblastomas multiforme), significantly different diffusion patterns were found among the three glioma groups. MK values increased with higher glioma malignancy, whereas ADCs tended to decrease with higher malignancy; FA values did not differ significantly among tumor groups. Significant differences between astrocytoma grades WHO II and WHO III were demonstrated only by DK values. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for normalized MK (0.972) during testing to discriminate between low- and high-grade gliomas. Conclusion: This study demonstrates specific diffusion patterns for low- and high-grade gliomas, showing that DK imaging is able to depict microstructural changes within glioma tissue and is able to help differentiate among glioma grades.

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Water in biological structures often displays non-Gaussian diffusion behavior. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of non-Gaussian fitting by using the kurtosis model of the signal intensity decay curves obtained from DWI by using an extended range of b-values in studies of phantoms and HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with HNSCC underwent DWI by using 6 b-factors (0, 50-1500 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T. Monoexponential (yielding ADC(mono)) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (yielding apparent diffusion coefficient D(app) and apparent kurtosis coefficient K(app)) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and spinal cord). DWI studies were also performed on phantoms containing either water or homogenized asparagus. To determine whether the kurtosis model provided a significantly better fit than did the monoexponential model, an F test was performed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations between K(app) and D(app). RESULTS: The kurtosis model fit the experimental data points significantly better than did the monoexponential model (P < .05). D(app) was approximately twice the value of ADC(mono) (eg, in neck nodal metastases D(app) was 1.54 and ADC(mono) was 0.84). K(app) showed a weak Spearman correlation with D(app) in a homogenized asparagus phantom and for 44% of tumor lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of kurtosis modeling to fit DWI data acquired by using an extended b-value range in HNSCC is feasible and yields a significantly better fit of the data than does monoexponential modeling. It also provides an additional parameter, K(app), potentially with added value.",

        "AB": "Generalized diffusion tensor imaging (GDTI) using higher-order tensor (HOT) statistics generalizes the technique of diffusion tensor imaging by including the effect of nongaussian diffusion on the signal of MRI. In GDTI-HOT, the effect of nongaussian diffusion is characterized by higher-order tensor statistics (i.e., the cumulant tensors or the moment tensors), such as the covariance matrix (the second-order cumulant tensor), the skewness tensor (the third-order cumulant tensor), and the kurtosis tensor (the fourth-order cumulant tensor). Previously, Monte Carlo simulations have been applied to verify the validity of this technique in reconstructing complicated fiber structures. However, no in vivo implementation of GDTI-HOT has been reported. The primary goal of this study is to establish GDTI-HOT as a feasible in vivo technique for imaging nongaussian diffusion. We show that probability distribution function of the molecular diffusion process can be measured in vivo with GDTI-HOT and be visualized with three-dimensional glyphs. By comparing GDTI-HOT to fiber structures that are revealed by the highest resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) possible in vivo, we show that the GDTI-HOT can accurately predict multiple fiber orientations within one white matter voxel. Furthermore, through bootstrap analysis we demonstrate that in vivo measurement of HOT elements is reproducible, with a small statistical variation that is similar to that of diffusion tensor imaging.",

        "AB": "PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of a proposed clinical diffusion imaging scheme for rapidly generating multiple b-value diffusion contrast in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our strategy for efficient image acquisition relies on the invariance property of the diffusion tensor eigenvectors to b-value. A simple addition to the conventional diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) data acquisition scheme used for tractography yields diffusion-weighted images at twice and three times the conventional b-value. An example from a neurosurgical brain tumor is shown. Apparent diffusion-weighted (ADW) images were calculated for b-values 800, 1600, and 2400 s/mm(2), and a map of excess diffusive kurtosis was computed from the three ADWs. RESULTS: High b-value ADW images demonstrated decreased contrast between normal gray and white matter, while the heterogeneity and contrast of the lesion was emphasized relative to conventional b-value data. Kurtosis maps indicated the deviation from Gaussian diffusive behavior. CONCLUSION: DTI data with multiple b-values and good SNR can be acquired in clinically reasonable times. High b-value ADW images show increased contrast and add information to conventional DWI. Ambiguity in conventional b-value images over whether hyperintense signal results from abnormally low diffusion, or abnormally long T(2), is better resolved in high b-value images.",

        "AB": "High b-value q-space diffusion imaging (QSI) and conventional DTI methodologies were used to study the MRI diffusion characteristics of excised brains of 21-day-old myelin-deficient (md) rats and their age-matched controls. Three different indices were calculated from the QSI data, i.e., Displacement, Probability and Kurtosis, for the purpose of evaluating the effect of the myelin sheaths on the MR diffusion characteristics in white matter (WM) ROIs of the md versus control brains. The examined WM ROIs were the corpus callosum, the external capsule, and the internal capsule. In all examined WM ROIs, significant differences were observed between the md and control brains for all QSI indices. These differences reveal that myelin sheaths surrounding the axons in WM ROIs mostly affect the component exhibiting restricted diffusion, which is manifested by low mean displacement values and high probability and kurtosis values. Such differences were found to be more pronounced in long diffusion times, i.e., Delta=200 ms. Conventional DTI performed with relatively low b-values (b<1500 s/mm2) was also used to study md versus control brains. Interestingly, the fractional anisotropy (FA) index, which was calculated from DTI data, did not reveal any significant difference between the groups in the examined WM ROIs. However, some distinctions were revealed by the three eigenvalues (lambda1, lambda2, and lambda3) obtained from the tensor analysis. These findings were supported by Voxel-based analysis using SPM. Finally, MRI-guided histology showed very good agreement between myelin-stained regions and regions with highly restricted diffusion detected by QSI.",

        "AB": "MR Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was proposed recently to study the deviation of water diffusion from Gaussian distribution. Mean kurtosis (MK), directionally averaged kurtosis, has been shown to be useful in assessing pathophysilogical changes. However, MK is not sensitive to kurtosis change occurring along a specific direction. Therefore, orthogonal transformation of the 4th order kurtosis tensor was introduced in the current study to compute kurtoses along the 3 eigenvector directions of the 2nd order diffusion tensor. Such axial (K( parallel)) and radial (K perpendicular) kurtoses measured the kurtoses along the directions parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the principal diffusion direction. DKI experiments were performed in normal adult and formalin-fixed rat brain, and developmental brains. The results showed that directional kurtosis analysis revealed different information for tissue characterization.",

        "AB": "Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) can be used to estimate excess kurtosis, which is a dimensionless measure for the deviation of water diffusion profile from Gaussian distribution. Several recent studies have applied DKI to probe the restricted water diffusion in biological tissues. The directional analysis has also been developed to obtain the directionally specific kurtosis. However, these studies could not directly evaluate the sensitivity of DKI in detecting subtle neural tissue alterations. Brain maturation is known to involve various biological events that can affect water diffusion properties, thus providing a sensitive platform to evaluate the efficacy of DKI. In this study, in vivo DKI experiments were performed in normal Sprague-Dawley rats of 3 different ages: postnatal days 13, 31 and 120 (N=6 for each group). Regional analysis was then performed for 4 white matter (WM) and 3 gray matter (GM) structures. Diffusivity and kurtosis estimates derived from DKI were shown to be highly sensitive to the developmental changes in these chosen structures. Conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were also computed using monoexponential model, yielding reduced sensitivity and directional specificity in monitoring the brain maturation changes. These results demonstrated that, by measuring directionally specific diffusivity and kurtosis, DKI offers a more comprehensive and sensitive detection of tissue microstructural changes. Such imaging advance can provide a better MR diffusion characterization of neural tissues, both WM and GM, in normal, developmental and pathological states.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measures of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean kurtosis (MK) were compared in the prefrontal brain cortex of 24 healthy volunteers (adolescents, young adults, and elderly) ranging from age 13 to 85 years. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare subject groups with respect to the diffusion measures, and linear regression was used to characterize the change in each diffusion measure as a function of age. RESULTS: We found significant age-related changes in the elderly adult group, with increase of MD and decrease of FA. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates distinct mean kurtosis patterns for different age-ranges, with significant age-related correlation for mean kurtosis (MK) and MK peak position, showing that diffusional kurtosis is able to characterize and measure age-related diffusion changes for both grey and white matter, in the developing and aging brain.",

In this study, an approximation for the ODF of water diffusion from diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is presented. DKI requires only a relatively limited number of diffusion measurements and, for the brain, b values no higher than 2500 s/mm(2). The DKI-based ODF approximation is decomposed into two components representing the Gaussian and non-Gaussian (NG) diffusion contributions, respectively. Simulations of multiple fiber configurations show that both the total and the NG-ODF are able to resolve the orientations of the component fibers, with the NG-ODF being the most sensitive to profiling the fibers' directions. Orientation maps obtained for in vivo brain imaging data demonstrate multiple fiber components in brain regions with complex anatomy. The results appear to be in agreement with known white matter architecture.",

Residuals were also compared. RESULTS: Strong linear correlation was found for all parameters. MLP estimates were unbiased for the biexponential but not for the kurtosis model, and generally had smaller variance. Residuals were smaller for MLP estimates. The maps generated by the two methods were visually very similar. CONCLUSION: Multi-layer perceptrons are potentially useful as a curve fitting method for these models.",

Mean kurtosis, the directionally averaged kurtosis, has been shown to be useful in assessing pathophysiological changes, thus yielding another dimension of information to characterize water diffusion in biological tissues. In this study, orthogonal transformation of the 4th order diffusion kurtosis tensor was introduced to compute the diffusion kurtoses along the three eigenvector directions of the 2nd order diffusion tensor. Such axial (K(//)) and radial (K( upper left and right quadrants)) kurtoses measured the kurtoses along the directions parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the principal diffusion direction. DKI experiments were performed in normal adult (N=7) and formalin-fixed rat brains (N=5). DKI estimates were documented for various white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissues, and compared with the conventional diffusion tensor estimates. The results showed that kurtosis estimates revealed different information for tissue characterization. For example, K(//) and K( upper left and right quadrants) under formalin fixation condition exhibited large and moderate increases in WM while they showed little change in GM despite the overall dramatic decrease of axial and radial diffusivities in both WM and GM. These findings indicate that directional kurtosis analysis can provide additional microstructural information in characterizing neural tissues.",

        "AB": "OBJECT: Clinical diffusion imaging is based on two assumptions of limited validity: that the radial projections of the diffusion propagator are Gaussian, and that a single directional diffusivity maximum exists in each voxel. The former can be removed using the biexponential and diffusional kurtosis models, the latter using generalised diffusion-tensor imaging. This study provides normative data for these three models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects were imaged. Maps of the biexponential parameters D (fast), D (slow) and f (slow), of D and K from the diffusional kurtosis model, and of diffusivity D' were obtained. Maps of generalised anisotropy (GA) and scaled entropy(SE) were also generated, for second and fourth rank tensors. Normative values were obtained for 26 regions. RESULTS: In grey versus white matter, D (slow) and D' were higher and D (fast), f (slow) and K were lower. With respect to maps of D', anatomical contrast was stronger in maps of D (slow) and K. Elevating tensor rank increased SE, generally more significantly than GA, in: anterior limb of internal capsule, corpus callosum, deep frontal and subcortical white matter, along superior longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum. CONCLUSION: The values reported herein can be used for reference in future studies and in clinical settings.",

Measurements were performed using a stimulated-echo pulse-sequence on n-decane as well as on polyethylene glycol (PEG) mixed with different concentrations of water, in order to obtain bi-exponential signal decay curves. The diffusion coefficients as well as the modelled diffusional kurtosis K(fit) were obtained from the signal decay curve, while the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the diffusional kurtosis K were obtained from the displacement distribution. Simulations of restricted diffusion, under conditions similar to those obtainable with a clinical MRI scanner, were carried out assuming various degrees of violation of the short gradient pulse (SGP) condition and of the long diffusion time limit. The results indicated that an MRI system can not be used for quantification of structural sizes less than about 10 microm by means of FWHM since the parameter underestimates the confinements due to violation of the SGP condition. However, FWHM can still be used as an important contrast parameter. The obtained kurtosis values were lower than expected from theory and the results showed that care must be taken when interpreting a kurtosis estimate deviating from zero.",

The diffusion properties of the fiber phantoms are measured using diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and bulk NMR measurements. To enable quantitative evaluation of the measurements, the diffusion in the interstitial space between fibers is modeled using Monte Carlo simulations of random walkers. The time-dependent apparent diffusion coefficient and kurtosis, quantifying the deviation from a Gaussian diffusion profile, are simulated in 3D geometries of parallel fibers with varying packing geometries and packing densities. The simulated diffusion coefficients are compared to the theory of diffusion in porous media, showing a good agreement. Based on the correspondence between simulations and experimental measurements, the fiber phantoms are shown to be useful for the quantitative validation of diffusion imaging on clinical MRI-scanners.",

        "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral white matter changes, termed leukoaraiosis (LA), appearing as areas of increased signal intensity in T2-weighted MR images, are common in elderly subjects, but the possible correlation of LA with cognitive or motor deficit has not been established. We hypothesized that histogram and voxel-based analyses of whole-brain mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps calculated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could be more sensitive tools than visual scales to investigate the clinical correlates of LA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients of the Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study were evaluated with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery for LA extension, T1-weighted images for volume, and DTI for MD and FA. The extent of LA was rated visually. The normalized total, gray, and white matter brain volumes were computed, as well as the 25th percentile, 50th percentile, kurtosis, and skewness of the MD and FA maps of the whole brain. Finally, voxel-based analysis on the maps of gray and white matter volume, MD, and FA was performed with SPM2 software. Correlation analyses between visual or computerized data and motor or neuropsychologic scale scores were performed using the Spearman rank test and the SPM2 software. RESULTS: The visual score correlated with some MD and FA histogram metrics (P<.01). However, only the 25th and 50th percentiles, kurtosis, and skewness of the MD and FA histograms correlated with motor or neuropsychologic deficits. Voxel-based analysis revealed a correlation (P<.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) between a large cluster of increased MD in the corpus callosum and pericallosal white matter and motor deficit. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that histogram and voxel-based analyses of the whole-brain MD and FA maps are more sensitive tools than the visual evaluation for clinical correlation in patients with LA.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed in six directions with 32 equally spaced q values and a maximum b value of 6600 s/mm(2). The shape of the signal-attenuation curve and the displacement propagator were examined and compared with a normal distribution using the kurtosis parameter. Maps displaying kurtosis, fast and slow components of the apparent diffusion coefficients, fractional anisotropy and directional diffusion were calculated. The displacement propagator was further described by the full width at half and at tenth maximum and by the probability density of zero displacement P(0). Three healthy volunteers and three patients with previously diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS) were examined. RESULTS: Simulations indicated that the kurtosis of a signal-attenuation curve can determine if more than one water component is present and that care must be taken to select an appropriate threshold. It was possible to distinguish MS plaques in both signal and diffusional kurtosis maps, and in one patient, plaques of different degree of demyelinization showed different behavior. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that in vivo q-space analysis is a potential tool for the assessment of different cerebral water components, and it might extend the diagnostic interpretation of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.",

        "AB": "Conventional clinical neuroimaging is insensitive to axonal injury in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunocytochemical staining reveals changes to axonal morphology within hours, suggesting potential for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) in early diagnosis and management of TBI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) characterizes the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of water diffusion, which is highly anisotropic in white matter fibers owing to axonal length. Recently, DTI has been used to investigate traumatic axonal injury (TAI), emphasizing regional analysis in more severe TBI. In the current study, we hypothesized that a global white matter (WM) analysis of DTI data would be sensitive to TAI across a spectrum of TBI severity and injury to scan interval. To investigate this, we compared WM-only histograms of a scalar, fractional anisotropy (FA), between 20 heterogeneous TBI patients recruited from Detroit Medical Center, including six mild TBI (GCS 13-15), and 14 healthy age-matched controls. FA histogram parameters were correlated with admission GCS and posttraumatic amnesia (PTA). In all cases, including mild TBI, patients' FA histograms were globally decreased compared with control histograms. The shape of the TBI histograms also differed from controls, being more peaked and skewed. The mean FA, kurtosis and skewness were highly correlated suggesting a common mechanism. FA histogram properties also correlated with injury severity indexed by GCS and PTA, with mean FA being the best predictor and duration of PTA (r = 0.64) being superior to GCS (r = 0.47). Therefore, in this heterogeneous sample, the FA mean accounted for 40% of the variance in PTA. Increased diffusion in the short axis dimension, likely reflecting dysmyelination and swelling of axons, accounted for most of the FA decrease. FA is globally deceased in WM, including mild TBI, possibly reflecting widespread involvement. FA changes appear to be correlated with injury severity suggesting a role in early diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.",

Several quantities can be extracted from the function that indicate a characteristic of the water diffusion in tissue, e.g., the mean displacement of the diffusion, probability for zero displacement, and kurtosis of the function. These quantities are expected to give information about the microstructure of tissues in addition to that obtained from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); however, this method requires high q (i.e., high b) values, which are undesirable in practical applications of the method using clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging equipment. We propose a method to obtain certain quantities that indicate a characteristic of the diffusion and that uses low q-value measurements. The quantities we can obtain are the moments of translational displacement, R; the n-th order moment is defined as the average of Rn (n: integer). Kurtosis can also be calculated from the second and fourth moments. We tried to map the moments and kurtosis using clinical MR imaging equipment. We also estimated the inherent errors of the moments obtained. Our method requires precision in measuring spin echo signals and setting q values rather than using high q-value measurements. Although our results show that further error reductions are desired, our method is workable using ordinary clinical MR imaging equipment.",

Asthma is primarily a disease of airway dysfunction, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with abnormalities in both the small airways and the alveoli. Conventional diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hyperpolarized noble gases, because of the short T(2)* of the gas, is only capable of monitoring diffusion over short times and hence only short distances. Diffusion imaging is therefore only sensitive to changes in small structures of the lung (primarily the alveoli), and will not adequately interrogate diffusion along the longitudinal axes of bronchi and bronchioles. In this communication we present a new method, termed diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), that is particularly sensitive to diffusion over longer distances. DKI may therefore be more sensitive to abnormalities in the bronchioles and bronchi than conventional diffusion imaging. Preliminary DKI measurements on healthy human subjects and one patient with symptoms suggestive of small airway disease are presented. Although the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the patient was similar to that in the normal controls, diffusional kurtosis was markedly reduced. This suggests that DKI measurements may be useful for assessing diseases of the small airways.",

Here we propose an approach to directly measure the non-Gaussian property of water diffusion, characterized by a four-dimensional matrix referred to as the diffusion kurtosis tensor. This approach does not require the complete measurement of the displacement distribution function and, therefore, is more time efficient compared with the q-space imaging technique. A theoretical framework of the DK calculation is established, and experimental results are presented for humans obtained within a clinically feasible time of about 10 min. The resulting kurtosis maps are shown to be robust and reproducible. Directionally-averaged apparent kurtosis coefficients (AKC, a unitless parameter) are 0.74 +/- 0.03, 1.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.84 +/- 0.02 for gray matter, white matter and thalamus, respectively. The three-dimensional kurtosis angular plots show tissue-specific geometry for different brain regions and demonstrate the potential of identifying multiple fiber structures in a single voxel. Diffusion kurtosis imaging is a useful method to study non-Gaussian diffusion behavior and can provide complementary information to that of DTI.",

        "AB": "A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.",

        "AB": "NMR q-space imaging is a method designed to obtain information from porous materials where diffusion-diffraction phenomena were observed from which pore size was derived. Recently, the technique has been applied to the study of biological structures as well. Although diffusive diffraction has so far not been observed in multicellular systems, displacement profiles have been used with some success as a means to estimate structure size. However, there have been no quantitative correlations of the retrieved structure sizes with histology. Clearly, the complexity of tissue architecture poses significant challenges to the interpretation of q-space data. In this work, simulations were first performed on a two-compartment model to demonstrate the effects of interference of the diffraction patterns arising from intra and extra-axonal compartments and finite boundary permeability on q-space data. Second, q-space echo attenuation was simulated on the basis of histologic images of various rat spinal cord fiber tracts and the information obtained from the displacement profiles were compared with structural parameters computed from the histologic images. The results show that calculated mean displacements and kurtosis parallel mean axon size and axonal density. Finally, spatially localized q-space measurements were carried out at the locations where simulations had previously been performed, resulting in displacement data that support those obtained by simulation. The data suggest the NMR q-space approach has potential for nondestructive analysis of the axonal architecture in the mammalian spinal cord.",
